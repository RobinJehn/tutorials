    "In this tutorial we will implement a RRT algorithm for a reduced model of the ur5 robot with only 2 degrees of freedom. This will allow us to visualise the 2D configuration space of the environment, as we saw in tutorial 0. We will then use the same code to plan a path for the complete robot. In tutorial 0, we were using local methods to find a path from one configuration to the other, with a significant failure rate. RRT, as a global planning method, is probabilistically complete, ie, if a solution exists, it is guaranteed to find it, eventually (this can take a while...)\n",

    "the pseudo-code for the RRT algorithm is rather simple (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly_exploring_random_tree)). RRT comes with a large variety of implementations and adaptations, depending on the targeted application.\n"

If the distance between $q_{rand}$ and $q_{near}$ is greater than a user-defined variable $\\Delta q$ and / or if the complete path is not valid, then the furthest configuration $q_{new}$ such that the path between $q_{rand}$ and $q_{new}$ is valid will be kept and added to the graph.\n",
